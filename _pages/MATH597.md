* **Private Matters**: For private discussions or questions, send a direct message to the instructors on Discord.
* **Submissions**: All notes and reports should be submitted via HackMD notes.

### Course Project
The course project is an opportunity to delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of data science. You can work individually or in a group. Choose one of the following project types:
1. **Theoretical Deep Dive**: Select a topic with a strong theoretical basis in data science and provide a comprehensive exploration, elucidating its key concepts, principles, and mathematical underpinnings.
2. **Algorithm in Action**: Choose a data science algorithm, implement it, and apply it to a real-world dataset. Showcase its practical utility and interpret the results.
3. **Theory Meets Practice**: Bridge the gap between theory and application. Introduce a topic or algorithm, explain its theoretical foundations, and then demonstrate its relevance and effectiveness by implementing it and analyzing its performance on real-world data.

**Important**: Please discuss your project topic with the instructor and finalize it by the end of September.
