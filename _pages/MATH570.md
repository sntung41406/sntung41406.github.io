**Unlock the power of quantitative analysis in finance.** As the foundational course in the Quantitative Data Science sequence, MATH 570 builds the rigorous mathematical, probabilistic, and statistical frameworks necessary for modern Quantitative Finance. We move beyond abstract theory to equip you with the tools needed for real-world financial modeling and data-driven decision-making.

### Course Description
Students will explore the core concepts of **probabilistic modeling** (including conditional independence and copulas) and **mean-covariance statistics**. The course bridges theory and practice through a balanced curriculum:
* **Theory (40%)**: Lectures focusing on mathematical intuition, rigorous concepts, and derivations.
* **Context (20%)**: Analysis of real-world financial problems and influential academic papers.
* **Implementation (40%)**: Hands-on coding assignments utilizing **Python** for sophisticated data analysis.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Apply** suitable data-driven models to interpret and explain complex financial datasets.
2. **Analyze** large-scale financial data using **Python (NumPy/Pandas)** to derive actionable quantitative insights.
3. **Evaluate** academic financial literature and **replicate** theoretical models through rigorous computational implementation.
4. **Communicate** technical findings and methodology effectively using **Markdown** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

### Prerequisites
* **Mathematics**: Strong proficiency in Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory.
* **Programming**: Basic proficiency in **Python** (specifically NumPy and Pandas).

---

### Evaluation & Projects
* **Coding Assignments (50%)**: Biweekly problem sets requiring the application of mathematical concepts through Python-based simulations and analysis.
* **Final Project (50%)**: A substantial independent or group project. You will demonstrate mastery of a core course concept by analyzing a financial dataset of your choice, presented through professional data visualizations and quantitative metrics.

**Project Milestone**: Finalize your teammates and discuss your topic with the instructor by the **end of March**.
