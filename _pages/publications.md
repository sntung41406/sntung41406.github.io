I am a mathematical researcher specializing in the **Mathematical and Stochastic Modelling of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**. My work bridges rigorous **Mathematical Finance** and **Applied Probability** with **Data Science** to analyze and optimize the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem. My primary focus is on developing sophisticated models for **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**, contributing to both the theoretical understanding and the practical applications that will shape the future of finance.



## Current Research Areas
My current research program is focused on deriving robust analytical and computational frameworks for decentralized financial systems:

* **Stochastic Control and Game Theory in AMMs:**
    * **Arbitrage Dynamics:** Investigating the non-myopic strategic interaction between arbitrageurs and AMMs, framed as a *stochastic control/game*, to characterize the equilibrium price and liquidity dynamics.
    * **Optimal LP Strategy:** Solving the Liquidity Provider's *dynamic liquidity provision strategy*, which involves *optimal control problems* under the constraints of singular processes.

* **Liquidity Modelling and Pricing:**
    * **Decentralized Liquidity:** Developing a novel mathematical framework to *model decentralized exchange liquidity dynamics* in continuous time, focusing on the rigorous formulation of the evolving liquidity surface.
    * **Pricing Liquidity:** *Relating liquidity provision to classical option pricing theory* to build a practical *fair fee mechanism* through data-driven approaches. This aims to quantify the cost and risk of providing liquidity.
    
* **Applied AI in Decentralized/Quantitative Finance:**
    * **Market Microstructure:** Analyzing blockchain data to identify and model *unique patterns in Web3*** using techniques from data science.
    * **Financial Optimization/Planning:** Applying advanced machine learning, such as *Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)* and *World Models*, to build robust market-making strategies that explicitly manage the heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian risks inherent in decentralized markets.
