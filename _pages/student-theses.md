## Mentoring Philosophy
My mentoring philosophy centers on integrating **mathematical rigor** with the **practical and computational applications** of these concepts in quantitative finance and data science. My goal is to equip students with the analytical skills needed for advanced study and industry innovation.

For both graduate and undergraduate students, my mentorship style is structured to foster **independent, high-impact research** and **comprehensive professional development**.

### Key Mentorship Goals
* **Rigorous Foundation:** Ensuring students master the theoretical underpinnings required for high-level research in mathematical finance and data science.
* **Problem-Driven Approach:** Encouraging students to identify, formulate, and mathematically model open problems in cutting-edge areas of their own interest, particularly in **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**.
* **Professional Development:** Providing guidance on academic, and cultivating professional practice skills applicable to both academia and industry.

## Current Research Groups

I currently supervise and lead three active research groups, emphasizing collaborative and project-driven learning.

* **Quantitative Trading & Hedging:** This group focuses on developing and implementing *machine learning models* for trading various financial instruments (e.g., stocks, futures, options).
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Modeling:** This group explores the mathematical and computational aspects of DeFi, including *modeling Automated Market Makers (AMMs)* (e.g., Uniswap, Curve), analyzing *liquidity provider rewards*, and optimizing complex yield farming strategies.
* **Computational AI & High-Performance Computing (HPC):** This group utilizes [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) to conduct high-performance numerical computations and implement state-of-the-art AI algorithms (e.g., Distributional Reinforcement Learning) for theoretical and practical applications in real world.
