I love advising students! There is immense fulfillment in guiding someone through a difficult and state-of-the-art topic. Through student advising, I have gained several research opportunities.



## Current Groups
* **Quantitative Trading:** This group focuses on developing and implementing quantitative models for trading various financial instruments (e.g., stocks, futures, options).
* **DeFi:** This group explores the mathematical and computational aspects of decentralized finance, including AMMs (e.g., Uniswap, Curve) and yield farming strategies (e.g., lending, fixed-yield).
